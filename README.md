# Inquisitio by LuckySevyn

## Overview
**Inquisitio** is a tool that I designed to gather comprehensive system information from a Windows machine. The script collects details such as OS version, user accounts, network configuration, firewall settings, running services, scheduled tasks, and much more. It outputs all collected information into a neatly formatted log file named `Inquisitio.txt`, which is saved in the same directory where the script is executed.

## Features
- Displays a custom banner before running the system commands.
- Collects detailed system information:
  - Operating system version and hostname
  - Current user information
  - User accounts on the system
  - IP configuration details
  - Routing table, ARP cache, and active network connections
  - Group policy results
  - Firewall state and configuration
  - Scheduled tasks and running services
  - Drivers installed on the system
  - Registry information regarding AlwaysInstallElevated policy
  - Searches for sensitive files (e.g., files containing "pass", "cred", or `.config` files)
- Generates a log file (`Inquisitio.txt`) summarizing all information in a readable format.
- Simple to use with no prerequisites other than running the script on a Windows system.

## How to Use

1. **Download the Script:**
   Save the script file (`Inquisitio.bat`) to any directory on your Windows machine.

2. **Run the Script:**
   - Open a Command Prompt with **Administrator privileges** (right-click on the Command Prompt icon and select *Run as administrator*).
   - Navigate to the directory where `Inquisitio.bat` is located.
   - Type the following command and hit **Enter**:
     ```cmd
     Inquisitio.bat
     ```

3. **Wait for Execution:**
   - The script will display a banner and a message: "Please wait for the results...".
   - The system commands will execute, and the results will be saved to the log file.

4. **View the Log File:**
   - Once the script completes, a file named `Inquisitio.txt` will be created in the same directory as the script.
   - Open the log file with any text editor (e.g., Notepad) to view the system information collected.

5. **Completion:**
   - After the execution, the script will notify you that the report was generated and pause until you press any key to exit.

## Script Output

The generated log file (`Inquisitio.txt`) contains the following sections:
- **Operating System Information**: OS name and version.
